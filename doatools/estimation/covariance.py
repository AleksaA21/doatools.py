        Based on the array design, creates an callable object that transforms
        covariance matrices obtained from the physical array model into
        augmented covariance matrices under the difference coarray model.

        Transforms the input covariance matrix into the augmented covariance
        matrix under the difference coarray model.

        Args:
            R: Covariance matrix.
            method: 'ss' for spatial-smoothing based construction, and 'da'
                for direct-augmentation based construction. It should be noted
                that direct-augmentation does not guarantee the
                positive-definiteness of `Ra`, which may lead to unexpected
                results when using beamforming-based estimators.
          
        Returns:
            Ra: Augmented covariance matrix.
            vula: The virtual ULA associated with the augmented covariance
                matrix, to be used together with `Ra` for DOA estimation.
